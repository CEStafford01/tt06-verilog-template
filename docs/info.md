## How it works

This project is a cycling traffic light for a two road intersection with left-hand turn lanes. 
The progam runs through a cycle of phases being; All red, Left turn road B, Road B green and left turn yellow, all road B yellow, All red, Left turn road A, Road A green and left turn yellow, all road A yellow,... and so on, in repeat. 
Where road b is the road running "vertically" through the displasy and road A is the road running "horizontally" through the display.
The signals are represented on a 2 digit display (2 seven-segment displays).
